    The topic of PRNGs consists of several smaller parts.
    From a mathematical point of view, one has to talk about their definition and construction as well as methods on how to test their randomness.
    There have been a lot of publications concerning these issues.
    Hence, I am not able to give you a detailed overview.
    Instead, I will focus on the most relevant PRNGs and test suites, as well as some modern examples.

    The creation of new PRNGs is sometimes understood to be black magic and can be hard since basically, one has to build a deterministic algorithm with a nearly non-deterministic output.
    In \cite{kneusel2018} one can find numerous different families of PRNGs.
    The most well-known ones are Linear Congruential Generators, Mersenne Twisters and Xorshift with its Variants.
    Whereas LCGs tend to be fast but weak generators in \cite{oneill2014}, one can find a further developed promising family of algorithms, called PCGs.
    \cite{widynski2019} describes another RNG based on the so-called middle square Weyl sequence.
    All of these generators have certain advantages and disadvantages in different areas such as security, games, and simulations.

    After building a PRNG, one has to check if the generated sequence of random numbers fulfills certain properties.
    In general, these properties will somehow measure the randomness of our RNG.
    Typically, there are a lot of tests bundled inside a test suite such as TestU01 and Dieharder.
