      The topic of this thesis is the development of a software library, called \citetitle{pxart}, in the C++ programming language that makes it possible to improve the performance of physical simulations that need to use random numbers.
      The library consists of pseudorandom number generators exploiting the SSE and AVX instruction set facilities of modern Intel processors.
      We created a new interface to simplify their initialization and usage.
      % Through the implementation of appropriate benchmarks and physically-based applications, like photon propagation and the Ising model, we were able to show that our generators could indeed accelerate the execution of randomized algorithms.
